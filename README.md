#index file creation for login.ysbdemowebsite.in

Index file is designed with HTML elements with bootstab col modules. 
For mouse movements and tracking the background image, JS queries included with the head of index file. 
So, you will need to add all the JS and bootstap Css files with the index to get the proper indtended effect.
Right the mouse hovering effct is working wth Chrome only, I'm looking for the optimization/compatability with other browsers. 


#yet to add
This page gonna integrate with MySql and PHP as it gate access for my teammates. 
PHP integration and DB connection is still under construction.
Once its properly done, I will adding those scripts as well on this same repository. 

Thank you!
